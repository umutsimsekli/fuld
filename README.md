# Fractional Underdamped Langevin Dynamics: Retargeting SGD with Momentum under Heavy-Tailed Gradient Noise

The optimizer implementation for the paper "Fractional Underdamped Langevin Dynamics: Retargeting SGD with Momentum under Heavy-Tailed Gradient Noise", published in ICML 2020.

The class SGD_fm should be used as a pytorch optimizer. See https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html for details.
